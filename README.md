# Eat-Da-Burger

## Description

Node Express application deployed on Heroku that uses MySql for the database and uses Handlebars to render the HTML. When the user loads the home page, they may enter in the text box different types of burgers they would like to eat, which will display as a list on the left side of the page after they click on the submit button. Once the user clicks, "Devour it", the item on the left will appear on the right side as a list again indicating the item they chose has been devoured.
